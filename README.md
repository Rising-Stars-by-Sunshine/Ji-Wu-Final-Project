# Fusing Structured and Textual Features for King County House Price Prediction

## Project Overview
This project presents a novel approach to house price prediction by integrating structured numerical data with textual property descriptions generated via AI. By leveraging advanced supervised learning techniques and exploring supplementary causal inference methods, the study aims to improve predictive accuracy and provide insights into the impact of qualitative features on property valuation.
